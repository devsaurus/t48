Change log for the T48 uController core
=======================================
Version: $Date: 2004-10-26 21:41:38 $


Release 0.5 BETA
----------------

* Bugfix for "P1 constantly in push-pull mode in t8048"
  Applied in t8048.vhd 1.3

* Bugfix for "RD' and WR' not asserted for INS A, BUS and OUTL BUS, A"
  Applied in decoder.vhd 1.16
             db_bus.vhd 1.3
  Updated testcase black_box/ins.

* P1, P2 and BUS are written during the first instruction cycle of the
  OUTL instruction. This matches the descirption in the User Manual.
  The previous implementation updated these ports at the end of the
  second instruction cycle.
  Applied in decoder.vhd 1.16

* Shifted deassertion of RD and WR to end of XTAL3 of machine state 2.
  The previous deassertion at the end of XTAL2 was not according to the
  User Manual. Their rising edge can now be used as a read/write strobe.
  On the other hand, PROG is still deasserted at the end of XTAL3. This
  is needed to for the rising edge of PROG within valid P2 expander data.
  Applied in clock_ctrl.vhd 1.6
