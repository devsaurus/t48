Change log for the T48 uController core
=======================================
Version: $Date: 2005-10-16 08:10:35 $


Release 0.6 BETA
----------------

* Bugfix for "Wrong clock applied to T0"
  Applied in clock_ctrl.vhd 1.7
             t48_core.vhd 1.8

* Introduced "notri" hierarchy for t8048 and t8039 system.
  This allows the usage of such a system without tri-state signals.

* Fixed lpm_memory type definition in lpm_rom.vhd and lpm_ram.vhd.

* New Wishbone master module: wb_master.vhd

* New system toplevel: t8050_wb.vhd
  Contains the Wishbone master.

* Prefixed all design units with 't48_'.

* Updates for running the core with full xtal clock. Should work now.

* Move latching of BUS to MSTATE2 in decoder.vhd
    -> sample BUS at the end of RD'

* Fix a glitch on PCH when an interrupt occurs during external
  program memory fetch in decoder.vhd

* Bugfix for "Target address of JMP to Program Memory Bank 1 corrupted
              by interrupt"
  and        "Return address of CALL to Program Memory Bank 1 corrupted
              by interrupt"
  Applied in int.vhd 1.5

* Bugfix for "MSB of Program Counter changed upon PC increment"
  Applied in pmem_ctrl.vhd 1.4

* Preliminary Integration Manual added.


Release 0.5 BETA
----------------

* Bugfix for "P1 constantly in push-pull mode in t8048"
  Applied in t8048.vhd 1.3

* Bugfix for "RD' and WR' not asserted for INS A, BUS and OUTL BUS, A"
  Applied in decoder.vhd 1.16
             db_bus.vhd 1.3
  Updated testcase black_box/ins.

* P1, P2 and BUS are written during the first instruction cycle of the
  OUTL instruction. This matches the descirption in the User Manual.
  The previous implementation updated these ports at the end of the
  second instruction cycle.
  Applied in decoder.vhd 1.16

* Shifted deassertion of RD and WR to end of XTAL3 of machine state 2.
  The previous deassertion at the end of XTAL2 was not according to the
  User Manual. Their rising edge can now be used as a read/write strobe.
  On the other hand, PROG is still deasserted at the end of XTAL3. This
  is needed to for the rising edge of PROG within valid P2 expander data.
  Applied in clock_ctrl.vhd 1.6
